I am a data scientist, and I want to extract useful data from a description in a Vietnamese real estate post.
I’ll provide you with that description, and you must only return the keys and values in Python dictionary format without any introduction.
The keys contain those properties: alleyway_property, legal_status, under_mortgage, residential_purpose, has_basement, numbers_of_floors, residential_purpose
Alleyway_property only contains 1 or 0, default is None. 
under_mortgage only contains 1 or 0, default is 0.
residential_purpose  only contains 0 and 1, default value is 1, it ensures the buyer have full ownership rights for residential purposes.
has_basement only contains 1 or 0, default is 0. has_rooftop only contains 1 or 0, default is 0.
numbers_of_floors is a integer number, greater or equal 0, default is 0, doesn't include the ground floor and rooftoop floor.
If the description doesn't contain enough information to determine the value of a property, the corresponding value in the dictionary should be set to default value. 
This is the description in Vietnamese:

(The response mustn't contain any explanation and only contain a dictionary without further explanation.)
